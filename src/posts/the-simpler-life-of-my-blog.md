     Hello, welcome to my blog, in here, I'll post some things about coding and security. 

 This blog is powered by [11ty](https://11ty.dev) Who allowed the automatization of this blog, before i had  to create posts manually in HTML, and add them manually to the index file.

Now, i just create a file in **Markdown**, put the title, the content and thats it! Its so much simpler and easier, it jus takes some simple steps to convert your static HTML blog into an easy-to-use blog!

   The best part is that this blog is still programmed in html, the structure is the same, because thanks to **11ty**, it automatically converts your markdown files into HTML!

I really recommend you to check it out, I used the [11ty.rocks](https://11ty.rocks)guide to convert mine.
    
   Thanks for reading!
