     Hello, welcome to my blog, in here, I'll post some things about coding and security. <br> 
     This blog is powered by <a href="https://11ty.dev">11ty</a>. Who allowed the automatization of this blog, before i had <br> to create posts manually in HTML, and add them manually to the index file. Now, i just create a file in <b>Markdown</b>, put the title, the content <br> and thats it! Its so much simpler and easier, it jus takes some simple steps to convert your <br> static HTML blog into an easy-to-use blog!
       <p>The best part is that this blog is still programmed in html, the structure is the same, because thanks to <b>11ty</b>, it automatically converts your markdown files into HTML!</p> 
        
       <p>Thanks for reading!</p>
